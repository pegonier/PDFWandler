This Project is a try to build a small Application to parse content from PDF to HL7-V2
In this Version it's meant to read spezific Lab-Results and put them in an HL7-V2 ORU Message

To use in other cases, build an spezific Parse-Schema for your PDF
May you have to add some other Keys to the HL7 Parser Class, as well you should integrate your Document to the docSourceCheck

Feel free...
